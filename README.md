## :books: Projects
- **[Master's Thesis - Assessing Mobility Policies A Priori: A Change Detection Methodology Using Traffic Simulation](https://github.com/febagni/Thesis-Policy-Assessment-QT-EWMA)** Development of a framework that integrates microscopic traffic simulation with a nonparametric sequential change-detection algorithm (QT-EWMA) to evaluate, in advance, the efficacy and detection delays of proposed urban mobility interventions.
- **[Tennis Tracking - Image Analysis and Computer Vision project:](https://github.com/febagni/tennis-ball-tracker-computer-vision)** Project that, inputed a video of a tennis match, with normal TV view: tracks the path of the ball path, identify when a bounce occured, then it identifies the court, obtain its projection and maps exactly where the ball has bounced.
- **[Ventilation Estimation App (partnership with WHO):](https://github.com/AZANK7173/VentilationCalculator_App)** Flutter App that helps people discovering the infection risks of their environments. The user must provide, as input, the dimensions of their room and windows and the app will then use their location to obtain the rest of the data necessary to estimate the ventilation and air change of the place. This is finally compared to World Health Organization guidelines and it informs if changes in ventilation should be done.
- **[ARARA project - LLM for education:](https://github.com/febagni/Arara)** Streamlit application that receives PDF documents from lectures and uses GPT3.5 engine in order to create interactive questions and aid for students, without substitution of their critical thinking abilities.
- **[Smart Cities Temperature Analysis: ](https://github.com/febagni/smart-cities-temperature-analysis)** IoT project that aims to investigate air‐temperature variation across Giardini Indro Montanelli (Milan, Italy) and its surroundings, using sensor datasets to deliver insights about urban microclimates. The work combines Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, exploratory analysis and visualization, Node-RED flows to orchestrate sensor data collection and preprocessing, and mapping tools to produce spatial temperature maps. The results help understand environmental gradients, potentially guiding urban planning and climate resilience.
- **[FlinkFood (partnership with MiaPlatform):](https://github.com/FlinkFood/FlinkFood)** it is a project that addresses the challenge of providing users with informed decisions about restaurant choices, customized recommendations, and real-time delivery management. The project aims to implement a Data Fabric solution using Apache Flink. More about it [here](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/rasip/dsd/projects/flinkfood/project_description).
- **[Polimi Small Projects:](https://github.com/febagni/Polimi-Small-Projects)** Small projects developed during my Computer Science and Engineering Master's Degree. Theme range from: Deep Learning with CNNs and LSTMs, Machine Learning and applications, Robotics, Optimization algorithms, Software Engineering and more.
